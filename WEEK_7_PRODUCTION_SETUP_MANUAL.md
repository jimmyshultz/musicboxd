# Week 7: Production Setup & TestFlight - Manual Instructions

> **Goal**: Set up production environment and prepare for beta testing via TestFlight

## üìã Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Apple Developer Account ($99/year) - **REQUIRED FOR WEEK 7**
- [ ] Current development environment working
- [ ] Access to your existing development Supabase project
- [ ] Spotify API credentials
- [ ] **NEW APP NAME DECIDED** - Must complete Phase 0 first!

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Phase 0: App Name Change (PREREQUISITE)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Complete this phase BEFORE any other Week 7 tasks. Changing the app name after App Store Connect setup is much more complex.

### Step 0.1: Choose Your New App Identity
**‚è∞ Time Required**: 10 minutes planning

1. **Decide on**:
   - **App Name**: e.g., "SoundDiary", "TuneTracker", "MelodyLog"
   - **Bundle Identifier**: e.g., `com.yourname.sounddiary`
   - **Package Name**: e.g., `com.yourname.sounddiary`

2. **Verify availability**:
   - Check App Store for name conflicts
   - Ensure bundle ID is unique to you
   - Consider trademark issues

### Step 0.2: Systematic App Rename Process
**‚è∞ Time Required**: 1-2 hours

**This is a complex process involving 20+ files. Detailed rename instructions will be provided separately based on your chosen name.**

**Files that will need updates**:
- Core configuration (5 files)
- iOS project structure (folders, schemes, project files)
- Android package structure (Java files, manifests)
- Documentation (30+ markdown files)
- Build scripts and environment examples

**‚ö†Ô∏è BACKUP RECOMMENDATION**: Create a git branch before starting the rename process.

### Step 0.3: Verify Rename Success
**‚è∞ Time Required**: 30 minutes

1. **Test builds**:
   ```bash
   # Test iOS build
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   npm run ios
   
   # Test Android build  
   npm run android
   ```

2. **Verify**:
   - [ ] App launches with new name in title bar
   - [ ] No build errors or warnings
   - [ ] Bundle identifier updated correctly
   - [ ] All functionality still works

**‚úÖ ONLY PROCEED to Phase 1 after successful rename verification**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Do NOT proceed with other steps until Apple Developer enrollment is approved.

### Step 1.2: Configure App Store Connect
**‚è∞ After Apple Developer approval**

1. **Visit**: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/
2. **Sign in** with your Apple Developer account

## üóÑ Phase 2: Production Supabase Environment

### Step 2.1: Create Production Supabase Project
**‚è∞ Time Required**: 15 minutes

1. **Visit**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Create new project**:
   - **Organization**: Your organization
   - **Name**: `[your-app-name]-production`
   - **Database Password**: Generate strong password (save it!)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 3: Environment Configuration

### Step 3.1: Create Production Environment File
**‚è∞ Time Required**: 5 minutes

1. **Navigate to**: `/workspace/Resonare/` (renamed in Phase 0)

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key_here

# Same Spotify credentials as development
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
```

### Step 3.2: Update Bundle Identifier in Xcode
**‚è∞ Time Required**: 10 minutes

> **Note**: If you completed Phase 0 properly, this should already be done. Verify the settings match your new app identity.

1. **Open**: `Resonare.xcworkspace` in Xcode (renamed in Phase 0)
2. **Select**: Resonare project in navigator
3. **Select**: Resonare target
4. **General tab** ‚Üí **Identity**:

5. **Signing & Capabilities**:
   - **Team**: Select your Apple Developer team
   - **Provisioning Profile**: Xcode Managed Profile
6. **Build** project to verify no signing errors

---

## üçé Phase 4: Apple Sign-In Configuration

### Step 4.1: Enable Apple Sign-In Capability
**‚è∞ Time Required**: 10 minutes

1. **In Xcode** (Resonare project open):
2. **Select**: Resonare target
3. **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. **Click**: `+ Capability`
5. **Add**: "Sign in with Apple"
6. **Verify**: Capability appears in list

### Step 4.2: Configure Apple Developer Portal
**‚è∞ Time Required**: 10 minutes

1. **Visit**: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list
2. **Find**: Your app's Bundle ID (`[YOUR NEW BUNDLE ID]`)
3. **Edit**: Bundle ID configuration
4. **Enable**: "Sign in with Apple"
5. **Save** changes

### Step 4.3: Update Supabase Auth Configuration
**‚è∞ Time Required**: 15 minutes

1. **In production Supabase project**:
2. **Go to**: Authentication ‚Üí Providers
3. **Configure Apple provider**:
   - **Enable Apple provider**: ‚úÖ
   - **Client ID**: `[YOUR NEW BUNDLE ID]` (your Bundle ID)
   - **Team ID**: Find in Apple Developer Account ‚Üí Membership
   - **Key ID**: Create new key in Apple Developer ‚Üí Keys
   - **Private Key**: Download .p8 file content
4. **Save** configuration

**‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Steps 4.1-4.3 have been completed successfully.

---

## üçé Phase 4.5: Apple Sign-In Integration (BONUS)

> **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Apple Sign-In has been successfully integrated alongside Google Sign-In

### What Was Implemented

**üì¶ Dependencies Added**:
- `@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication` - React Native Apple Authentication library
- Updated iOS Podfile with `RNAppleAuthentication` pod

**üîß Code Integration**:
1. **AuthService Enhancement**:
   - Added `signInWithApple()` method with proper error handling
   - Added `isAppleSignInAvailable()` device compatibility check
   - Updated `signOut()` to handle both Google and Apple sessions

2. **Redux State Management**:
   - Added `signInWithApple` async thunk to auth slice
   - Integrated Apple Sign-In with existing user profile creation flow
   - Maintains consistent user experience across both sign-in methods

3. **UI Components**:
   - Added Apple Sign-In button to AuthScreen (iOS only)
   - Button appears automatically when Apple Sign-In is available
   - Consistent styling with Google Sign-In button

**üîê Security Features**:
- Uses Apple's native authentication flow
- Handles Apple's privacy-focused email relay
- Creates secure Supabase user accounts
- Maintains same username generation system as Google Sign-In

### How It Works

1. **Device Detection**: App automatically detects if Apple Sign-In is available
2. **Dual Options**: Users see both Google and Apple sign-in buttons on iOS devices
3. **Unified Flow**: Both sign-in methods create the same user profile structure
4. **Seamless Experience**: Existing users can switch between sign-in methods

### Testing Notes

- **iOS Simulator**: Apple Sign-In may not work in simulator - test on physical device
- **Development**: Requires Apple Developer account and proper entitlements
- **Production**: Will work automatically once deployed via TestFlight/App Store
- **Pod Installation**: Run `cd ios && pod install` to install the Apple Authentication pod

### Next Steps for Development Environment

**üö® IMPORTANT**: The Apple Sign-In library requires native iOS linking. Follow these steps:

**Option 1 - Quick Setup:**
```bash
cd Resonare
./install-pods.sh
npm run ios
```

**Option 2 - Manual Setup:**
```bash
cd Resonare/ios
pod install
cd ..
npm run ios
```

### Troubleshooting

**If you see "appleAuth.isAvailableAsync is not a function":**
1. ‚úÖ **Already Fixed**: The app now gracefully handles missing Apple Auth library
2. üì± **Shows Message**: iOS users see "Apple Sign-In will be available after running: cd ios && pod install"
3. üîÑ **Fallback**: App continues to work with Google Sign-In only until pods are installed

**After Pod Installation:**
- Apple Sign-In button will appear automatically on iOS devices
- Test on physical iOS device (may not work in simulator)
- Both Google and Apple sign-in will be fully functional

### üîç Quick Status Check

Run this command to verify your setup:
```bash
./verify-apple-signin.sh
```

This will show you exactly what's configured and what still needs to be done.
