# ðŸ”§ CocoaPods Build Configuration Fix

## Problem
After creating new build configurations (`Debug-Development`, `Debug-Staging`, etc.), CocoaPods doesn't have the necessary support files, causing build errors.

## Solution Steps

### **Step 1: Clean and Reinstall Pods**
```bash
cd ios
rm -rf Pods
rm -rf build
rm Podfile.lock
pod install
cd ..
```

### **Step 2: Clean React Native Cache**
```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### **Step 3: Clean Xcode Build Folder**
In Xcode:
1. **Product â†’ Clean Build Folder** (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. **Product â†’ Build** to verify it works

### **Step 4: Test the Environment Build**
```bash
npm run ios:dev
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Updated Podfile** - Added post_install hook to handle new build configurations
2. **Configuration Mapping** - Maps new configs to base Debug/Release settings
3. **Pod Support Files** - Reinstalling pods generates the missing xcfilelist files

## Alternative Quick Fix (If Above Doesn't Work)

If you're still getting errors, try this simpler approach:

### **Option A: Use Original Configurations**
Temporarily use the original configurations while testing:

```bash
# Use original Debug configuration instead of Debug-Development
ENVFILE=.env.development react-native run-ios --configuration Debug
```

### **Option B: Recreate Configurations in Xcode**
1. Open Xcode
2. **Delete** the custom configurations (Debug-Development, etc.)
3. **Recreate** them one by one
4. **Run pod install** after each creation

## Expected Result

After following these steps, you should be able to run:
- `npm run ios:dev` (Development environment)
- `npm run ios:staging` (Staging environment) 
- `npm run ios` (Default environment)

Each will use the appropriate environment variables and build configuration.
