# 🏠 Home Page Social Sections Fix

## Problem Identified
**Issue**: Popular This Week, New From Friends, and Popular With Friends sections showing no activity despite users having listened to albums and following each other.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Mock Data Usage
- **AlbumService.getUserListens()** was returning only mock data
- Mock data only existed for hardcoded user ID `'current-user-id'`
- Real users with actual database IDs had no data

### 2. Empty Popular Albums
- **AlbumService.getPopularAlbums()** was returning empty array
- Method was placeholder waiting for social features implementation

### 3. Wrong User Source for Friends
- **New From Friends** and **Popular With Friends** used `getSuggestedUsers()`
- Should use actual followed users via `getUserFollowing()`

### 4. Type Mismatches
- Code expected `User.profilePicture` but received `UserProfile.avatar_url`
- Color import using wrong theme structure

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. Real Database Integration

**Updated AlbumService.getUserListens():**
```typescript
// Before: Mock data only
return this.userListens.filter(listen => listen.userId === userId);

// After: Real database query
const albumListens = await albumListensService.getUserListensWithAlbums(userId);
return albumListens.map(listen => ({
  id: listen.id,
  userId: listen.user_id,
  albumId: listen.album_id,
  dateListened: new Date(listen.first_listened_at),
}));
```

**Added AlbumListensService.getUserListensWithAlbums():**
- Queries `album_listens` table with album details
- Returns real user listening data from database
- Ordered by most recent listens first

### ✅ 2. Real Popular Albums Implementation

**Updated AlbumService.getPopularAlbums():**
```typescript
// Before: Empty array
return { data: [], success: true };

// After: Real popularity calculation
// 1. Query album_listens for last 7 days
// 2. Group by album_id and count listens
// 3. Sort by popularity (most listens first)
// 4. Return top 15 albums
// 5. Fallback to mock data if no real data exists
```

### ✅ 3. Actual Friends Data

**Updated Home Page Sections:**
```typescript
// Before: Suggested users (random)
const users = await userService.getSuggestedUsers(currentUserId, 10);

// After: Actually followed users
const users = await userService.getUserFollowing(currentUserId);
```

### ✅ 4. Type Fixes

**Field Mapping:**
```typescript
// Before: 
profilePicture: friend.profilePicture // undefined

// After:
profilePicture: friend.avatar_url // correct field
```

**Import Fix:**
```typescript
// Before:
import { colors, spacing } from '../../utils/theme';

// After:
import { theme, spacing } from '../../utils/theme';
const colors = theme.colors;
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### 🎵 Popular This Week:
- **Shows albums** that have been listened to in the last 7 days
- **Sorted by popularity** (most listens first)
- **Falls back to mock albums** if no recent activity
- **Updates as users listen** to new albums

### 👥 New From Friends:
- **Shows activity** from users you actually follow
- **Displays recent listens** from followed users
- **Empty if no friends** or no recent friend activity
- **Real-time updates** as friends listen to albums

### 🔥 Popular With Friends:
- **Shows albums** popular among your followed users
- **Counts listens** from multiple friends per album
- **Sorted by friend engagement** (most friends listening)
- **Provides social discovery** of albums friends enjoy

## Testing Steps

### To Verify Fix Works:

1. **Set Up Test Data:**
   - Have 2 test user accounts
   - Make them follow each other
   - Have both users listen to some albums (mark as listened)

2. **Check Popular This Week:**
   - Should show albums that were listened to recently
   - If no recent activity, shows mock albums for testing

3. **Check New From Friends:**
   - Should show recent albums from users you follow
   - Empty if not following anyone or no friend activity

4. **Check Popular With Friends:**
   - Should show albums popular among your friends
   - Albums with multiple friend listens appear higher

### Debugging:

If sections still empty, check:
- Are users actually following each other?
- Do users have albums marked as listened in database?
- Check console for any error messages
- Verify `album_listens` table has data

## Database Requirements

### Required Tables (Schema V2):
- ✅ `album_listens` - stores user listening data
- ✅ `albums` - stores album metadata
- ✅ `user_follows` - stores follow relationships
- ✅ `user_profiles` - stores user profile data

### Data Flow:
1. User marks album as listened → `album_listens` table
2. User follows another user → `user_follows` table  
3. Home page queries → joins tables for social sections
4. Results processed → displayed in UI sections

## Performance Notes

- **Caching**: Consider adding caching for popular albums (refreshed hourly)
- **Pagination**: Large friend lists might need pagination
- **Debouncing**: Home page refreshes could be debounced
- **Fallbacks**: Mock data ensures sections never appear completely broken

**Result**: Home page social sections now display real user activity and provide genuine social music discovery! 🎉
