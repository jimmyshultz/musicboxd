# Profile Screen Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Recently Listened Section Not Loading
**Problem:** The "Recently Listened" section on the profile screen was empty and not displaying any albums.

**Root Cause:** 
- ProfileScreen was trying to access `userListens` from the old `albums` Redux slice
- Week 4 implementation moved listening data to the new `userAlbums` slice as `listeningHistory`
- The data structure changed from `Listen[]` to `AlbumWithInteraction[]`

**Fix:**
- Updated Redux selector to use `listeningHistory` from `state.userAlbums` instead of `userListens` from `state.albums`
- Added import for `fetchUserListeningHistory` thunk
- Updated `loadRecentActivity` function to properly convert `AlbumWithInteraction` data to expected `Album` and `Listen` formats
- Added proper data structure conversion mapping database fields to UI types

### 2. Profile Page Constantly Reloading
**Problem:** The profile screen was stuck in an infinite loading loop, constantly trying to reload data.

**Root Cause:**
- `useEffect` dependency array included `userListens` and `userReviews` which were empty/undefined
- `loadRecentActivity` was trying to fetch data inside the function, causing re-renders
- Dependencies were triggering the effect repeatedly

**Fix:**
- Separated data fetching into a dedicated `useEffect` for initial loading
- Removed data fetching logic from `loadRecentActivity` function
- Updated dependency arrays to only include stable references
- Simplified the loading flow to avoid circular dependencies

## Files Modified

### `Musicboxd/src/screens/Profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Updated Imports:**
   ```typescript
   import { fetchUserAlbumStats, fetchUserListeningHistory } from '../../store/slices/userAlbumsSlice';
   ```

2. **Updated Redux Selectors:**
   ```typescript
   // OLD
   const { userListens, userReviews } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.albums);
   const { stats: databaseStats } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.userAlbums);

   // NEW
   const { userReviews } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.albums);
   const { stats: databaseStats, listeningHistory } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.userAlbums);
   ```

3. **Added Separate Data Fetching Effect:**
   ```typescript
   // Separate effect to fetch listening history initially
   useEffect(() => {
     if (user?.id && !listeningHistory) {
       dispatch(fetchUserListeningHistory({ userId: user.id, limit: 5 }));
     }
   }, [user?.id, listeningHistory, dispatch]);
   ```

4. **Updated loadRecentActivity Function:**
   - Removed data fetching logic that caused infinite loops
   - Added proper data conversion from `AlbumWithInteraction` to `Album` type
   - Fixed field mapping (`item.name` → `album.title`, `item.artist_name` → `album.artist`, etc.)
   - Updated sorting to use `interaction?.listened_at` field

5. **Simplified loadUserStats Function:**
   - Removed dependency on old `userListens` and `userReviews`
   - Updated dependency array to only include stable references
   - Simplified fallback stats when database stats aren't available

6. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - Added try-catch blocks around data loading
   - Better error logging for debugging

## Data Structure Mapping

### AlbumWithInteraction → Album Conversion:
```typescript
const album = {
  id: item.id,                    // Database album ID
  title: item.name,               // Database name → UI title  
  artist: item.artist_name,       // Database artist_name → UI artist
  releaseDate: item.release_date || '',
  genre: item.genres || [],
  coverImageUrl: item.image_url || '',
  spotifyUrl: item.spotify_url || '',
  totalTracks: item.total_tracks || 0,
  albumType: item.album_type || 'album',
  tracks: [], // Empty for now
};
```

### Interaction → Listen Conversion:
```typescript
const listen = {
  id: `listen_${item.id}_${user.id}`,
  userId: user.id,
  albumId: item.id,
  dateListened: new Date(item.interaction?.listened_at || Date.now()),
};
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

✅ **Recently Listened Section:**
- Shows up to 5 most recently listened albums
- Displays album artwork, title, and artist
- Includes listen dates from database
- Links reviews if available

✅ **Profile Loading:**
- No more infinite loading loops
- Single initial data fetch when user opens profile
- Proper loading states during data fetching
- Stable UI without constant re-renders

✅ **Data Flow:**
- `fetchUserListeningHistory` called once when profile loads
- Data stored in Redux `userAlbums.listeningHistory`
- UI updates automatically when data arrives
- No redundant API calls or re-fetching

## Testing Checklist

1. **Navigation to Profile:**
   - [ ] Profile loads without infinite loading
   - [ ] Recently listened section appears (if user has listened to albums)
   - [ ] No console errors about missing data

2. **Recently Listened Display:**
   - [ ] Shows actual albums user has marked as listened
   - [ ] Albums sorted by most recent listen date
   - [ ] Album artwork and metadata display correctly
   - [ ] Tapping albums navigates to album details

3. **Performance:**
   - [ ] No constant re-rendering/loading states
   - [ ] Single network request for listening history
   - [ ] Smooth scrolling and interactions

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - [ ] New users with no listening history show empty state gracefully
   - [ ] Network errors handled without crashes
   - [ ] Offline/connection issues don't cause infinite loading
