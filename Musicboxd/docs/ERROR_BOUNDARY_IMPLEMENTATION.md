# Error Boundary Implementation - Week 6

## âœ… **Implementation Complete**

### **What Was Implemented:**

1. **ErrorBoundary Component** (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
   - Top-level React error boundary to catch all unhandled errors
   - User-friendly error screen with retry functionality
   - Debug information in development mode
   - Prevents app crashes from killing beta testing

2. **App Integration** (`App.tsx`)
   - ErrorBoundary wraps the entire app at the highest level
   - Catches ALL React component errors throughout the app
   - Provides recovery mechanism for users

### **Key Features:**

- **Crash Prevention**: No React error will crash the app
- **User Recovery**: "Try Again" button to reset error state
- **Developer Debug**: Error details shown in development mode
- **Production Ready**: Clean error messages for users
- **Logging Ready**: Console logging for debugging (can be extended to crash reporting services)

## ðŸ§ª **Manual Testing Guide**

### **Core User Flows to Test:**

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Sign in with Google
   - Profile setup
   - Sign out

2. **Search & Discovery**
   - Search for albums
   - Navigate to album details
   - Rate albums
   - Mark as listened

3. **Social Features**
   - Search for users
   - Follow/unfollow users
   - View user profiles
   - Browse friend activity

4. **Profile Management**
   - View own profile
   - Edit profile information
   - View listening history
   - View diary entries

### **Testing for Crashes:**

**What to Look For:**
- White screen of death
- App force closes
- Unresponsive UI
- JavaScript errors that break functionality

**Common Crash Scenarios:**
- Network errors during API calls
- Invalid data from Spotify API
- Navigation errors
- Image loading failures
- Redux state inconsistencies

### **Testing the Error Boundary:**

To verify the error boundary works, you can temporarily add this test code to any screen:

```tsx
// TEMPORARY TEST CODE - Remove after testing
const TestErrorButton = () => {
  const [shouldThrow, setShouldThrow] = useState(false);
  
  if (shouldThrow) {
    throw new Error('Test error: ErrorBoundary working!');
  }
  
  return (
    <Button onPress={() => setShouldThrow(true)}>
      Test Error Boundary
    </Button>
  );
};
```

**Expected Result:**
- App shows error screen instead of crashing
- "Try Again" button resets the app
- Error details visible in development mode

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps:**

1. **Manual Testing** - Test all core user flows for crashes
2. **Bug Fixes** - Fix any crash-causing bugs found
3. **Production Testing** - Test on physical devices
4. **Crash Reporting** - Consider adding Crashlytics/Sentry integration

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria:**

- âœ… No app crashes during normal usage
- âœ… Users can recover from errors without force-closing app
- âœ… Error boundary catches and displays all React errors
- âœ… Core user flows work without crashing

## ðŸ”§ **Future Enhancements:**

- Crash reporting service integration (Crashlytics, Sentry)
- More granular error boundaries for specific features
- Error analytics and monitoring
- Automatic error recovery for specific error types
