# Story 1 Completion: Project Repository Setup

## Completed Tasks

âœ… Created key repository files:
- README.md with project overview
- .gitignore configured for React Native
- LICENSE file with MIT license
- Documentation for GitHub repository setup

## Manual Steps Required on GitHub.com

To complete this story, the following steps need to be performed on GitHub.com:

1. **Create the Repository**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it "musicboxd"
   - Choose private visibility initially
   - Select "Add a README file"
   - Choose "MIT License"
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Upload Initial Files**
   - Upload the .gitignore file we created
   - Replace the default README.md with our version
   - Create docs/ directory and upload our documentation files

3. **Configure Branch Protection**
   - Go to Settings > Branches
   - Click "Add rule"
   - Set up protection for main branch according to docs/github_setup.md
   - Create develop branch
   - Set up protection for develop branch

4. **Invite Team Members**
   - Go to Settings > Collaborators and teams
   - Add team members with appropriate access levels

## Decisions Made

1. **Branch Strategy**: Adopted a modified GitFlow workflow with main, develop, feature/*, bugfix/*, release/*, and hotfix/* branches.

2. **License**: Selected MIT License for its permissive nature and compatibility with open-source dependencies.

3. **Access Control**: Implemented strict branch protection on main and develop branches to ensure code quality.

4. **Repository Visibility**: Starting with private repository but planning to make it public once the MVP is ready.

## Next Steps (Story 2)

With the repository structure in place, we'll move on to Story 2: Development Environment Configuration, which includes:

- Setting up the React Native environment
- Documenting dependencies
- Creating setup instructions
- Verifying local build process on iOS and Android
- Configuring ESLint and Prettier

## Story 1 Status

Story 1 is considered complete once all manual GitHub.com steps are performed and verified.
