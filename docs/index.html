                <h3>12.1 Do Not Track</h3>
                <p>
                    Some web browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to 
                    interpret Do Not Track signals, our app does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals.
                </p>

                <h3>12.2 Third-Party Links</h3>
                <p>
                    Our app may contain links to third-party websites or services (such as Spotify album pages). 
                    We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to read 
                    their privacy policies.

                <h3>12.3 Open Source</h3>
