## Changes Made

### 1. Type Definitions Updated

#### `/Resonare/src/types/index.ts`
- Added `review?: string` field to `DiaryEntry` interface
- Maintains backward compatibility (field is optional)

```typescript
export interface DiaryEntry {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  albumId: string;
  diaryDate: string;
  ratingAtTime?: number;
  review?: string; // ✅ NEW
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### 2. Album Details Screen - Add to Diary Modal

#### `/Resonare/src/screens/Album/AlbumDetailsScreen.tsx`

**State Added:**
- `diaryReview: string` - Stores review text during creation
- Character limit enforcement: 280 characters maximum

**UI Changes:**
- Added TextInput component with multiline support (3 visible lines)
- Character counter display (e.g., "0/280")
- Review input appears after rating in the diary modal
- Placeholder text: "Share your thoughts about this album..."

**Functionality:**
- Review text is trimmed and passed to `createDiaryEntry` service
- Empty reviews are stored as `undefined` (null in database)
- Review state is reset when modal closes

**Styles Added:**
- `diaryReviewContainer` - Container styling
- `diaryReviewInput` - TextInput styling (min height 80px)
- `characterCount` - Character counter styling

### 3. Diary Entry Details Screen - Display & Edit

#### `/Resonare/src/screens/Profile/DiaryEntryDetailsScreen.tsx`

**State Added:**
- `editingReview: boolean` - Tracks edit mode
- `pendingReview: string` - Stores review during editing

**UI Changes:**

- Appears between "Edit Date" and "Delete"

**Handlers Added:**
- `handleEditReview()` - Enters edit mode, loads current review
- `handleCancelReview()` - Cancels editing, discards changes
- `handleSaveReview()` - Saves review to database via `updateDiaryEntry`

**Data Conversion:**

### 4. Diary Screen - List View Updates

#### `/Resonare/src/screens/Profile/DiaryScreen.tsx`

**Data Conversion:**
- Updated both `loadInitial` and `loadMore` conversion functions
- Includes `review: entry.notes || undefined` in all conversions
- Maintains consistency across all diary entry data flows

**Note:** Display of reviews in list view not implemented (could be Phase 2)

### 5. Share Feature Integration

**Existing Functionality Preserved:**
- Share view already referenced `entry.notes` in share image
- No changes needed - automatically benefits from new review data

## Technical Details

### Character Limit Enforcement
- Maximum: 280 characters
- Enforced in `onChangeText` handler (prevents exceeding limit)
- `maxLength` prop also set as backup
- Visual counter shows remaining characters

### Database Integration
- Uses existing `notes` TEXT field in `diary_entries` table
- No migration required - field already exists
- Service methods already support notes parameter:
  - `createDiaryEntry(userId, albumId, date, rating, notes)`
  - `updateDiaryEntry(entryId, { notes: string })`

### Data Flow
```
User Input (AlbumDetailsScreen)
  → diaryReview state
  → createDiaryEntry service call
  → Database (notes column)
  → getDiaryEntryById service call
  → DiaryEntry type with review field
  → Display in DiaryEntryDetailsScreen
```

### Redux Integration
- Uses existing `upsertDiaryEntry` action
- Updates maintain consistency across app state
- Review changes reflect immediately in UI

## User Experience

1. User opens album details
2. Taps "Add to Diary" button
3. Modal shows with optional review field
4. User types review (up to 280 chars)

## Validation & Constraints
