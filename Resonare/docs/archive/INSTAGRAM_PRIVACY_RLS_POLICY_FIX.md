# üîß Instagram Privacy RLS Policy Fix

## Problem Identified

Private profiles were **completely invisible** to existing followers due to an overly restrictive RLS policy on `user_profiles`:

```sql
-- OLD POLICY (Too Restrictive)
CREATE POLICY "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" ON public.user_profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (NOT is_private OR auth.uid() = id);
```

This made private profiles only visible to:
- ‚úÖ Public profiles ‚Üí Everyone  
- ‚ùå Private profiles ‚Üí **Only the profile owner**

But the Instagram model requires private profiles to be visible to **existing followers**.

## Root Cause

The debug revealed:
1. ‚úÖ **Follow relationships existed** in database
2. ‚úÖ **getFollowing() found the relationships** (`üìä Follow data found: 1 relationships`)
3. ‚ùå **Profile lookup returned 0 results** (`üë§ Profile data found: 0 profiles`)

The RLS policy was **blocking profile queries** for private users, even from their followers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated RLS Policy**

```sql
-- NEW POLICY (Instagram Privacy Model)
CREATE POLICY "Instagram privacy model for profiles" ON public.user_profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (
        NOT is_private                           -- Public profiles visible to all
        OR auth.uid() = id                       -- Own profile always visible
        OR EXISTS (                              -- Private profiles visible to followers
            SELECT 1 FROM public.user_follows 
            WHERE following_id = user_profiles.id 
            AND follower_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

### 2. **Updated Database Schema**

- Updated `/workspace/database/schema_v2.sql` with the correct policy
- This ensures future deployments use the Instagram model

### 3. **Simplified UserService**

- Removed complex manual privacy filtering from `searchUsers()`
- Let the database RLS policy handle privacy automatically
- Removed debug logging

## Manual Database Update Required

**You need to run this SQL in Supabase:**

```sql
-- 1. Drop the old restrictive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public profiles are viewable by everyone" ON public.user_profiles;

-- 2. Create new Instagram privacy model policy
CREATE POLICY "Instagram privacy model for profiles" ON public.user_profiles
    FOR SELECT USING (
        NOT is_private                           -- Public profiles visible to all
        OR auth.uid() = id                       -- Own profile always visible
        OR EXISTS (                              -- Private profiles visible to followers
            SELECT 1 FROM public.user_follows 
            WHERE following_id = user_profiles.id 
            AND follower_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### **From Public Profile:**
- ‚úÖ Can **search** and find private profile (if following)
- ‚úÖ Can see private profile in **Following** list
- ‚úÖ Can see private profile's **social stats** 
- ‚úÖ Private profile data appears in **home page feeds**

### **From Private Profile:**
- ‚úÖ Can see **all profiles** as before
- ‚úÖ **Follower/Following counts** work correctly

### **New Users:**
- ‚úÖ **Cannot see private profiles** until they send a follow request
- ‚úÖ **Follow requests work** as implemented

## Files Modified

1. **`/workspace/database/schema_v2.sql`** - Updated RLS policy
2. **`/workspace/Resonare/src/services/userService.ts`** - Simplified search logic, removed debug logs
3. **Documentation** - Created fix documentation

**After running the SQL update, the Instagram privacy model should work perfectly!** üéØ
