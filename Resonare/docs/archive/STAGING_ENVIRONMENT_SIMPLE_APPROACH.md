# ðŸš€ Simple Staging Environment Approach

## Current Issue
The custom build configurations are causing C++ compilation errors. This is complex to fix and not essential for completing Week 5.

## Recommended Simple Approach

### **Option 1: Manual Environment Switching**
1. **Create environment files** (as we did):
   - `.env.development`
   - `.env.staging` 
   - `.env.production`

2. **Copy the appropriate file** when switching environments:
   ```bash
   # For development
   cp .env.development .env
   
   # For staging
   cp .env.staging .env
   
   # For production  
   cp .env.production .env
   ```

3. **Use normal build commands**:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   npm run android
   ```

### **Option 2: Use ENVFILE (Simpler)**
Since `react-native-config` is installed, you can use:
```bash
# Development
ENVFILE=.env.development npm run ios

# Staging (when ready)
ENVFILE=.env.staging npm run ios
```

## Benefits of Simple Approach
- âœ… **No complex Xcode configuration** 
- âœ… **No build configuration errors**
- âœ… **Still have environment separation**
- âœ… **Can focus on completing Week 5**
- âœ… **Can upgrade to advanced setup later**

## For Week 5 Completion

**Use this simple approach:**

1. **Create `.env.development`** with your current credentials
2. **Create `.env.staging`** with staging Supabase credentials (when ready)
3. **Test with**: `ENVFILE=.env.development npm run ios`
4. **Complete Week 5 features**
5. **Set up advanced environment switching** in Week 6 or later

## When to Use Advanced Setup

The complex build configuration approach is better for:
- **Production apps** with CI/CD
- **Team development** with multiple developers
- **App Store distribution** with different bundle IDs

For now, the simple approach is **perfectly fine** for completing Week 5 and testing the Instagram privacy model.

**Recommendation: Let's complete Week 5 with the simple approach and revisit advanced staging setup later!** ðŸŽ¯
