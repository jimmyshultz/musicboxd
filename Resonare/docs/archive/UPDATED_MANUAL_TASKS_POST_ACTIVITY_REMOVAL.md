# 📋 Updated Manual Tasks - Post Activity Feed Removal

## 🎯 Week 5 Status: COMPLETED (Activity Feed Removed)

### ✅ Decision: Activity Feed Removed from MVP
- **Reason**: Database relationship complexity causing errors
- **Impact**: Focus on core social features that work reliably
- **Result**: Week 5 deliverables simplified and **completed**

---

## 🔧 Remaining Manual Tasks (Simplified)

### 1. Database Schema Verification (CRITICAL)
**Check your database uses Schema V2:**
1. Go to Supabase dashboard → Database → Tables
2. **Should see**: `album_listens`, `album_ratings`, `diary_entries`, `user_follows`, `user_profiles`
3. **If missing**: Run `/workspace/database/schema_v2.sql` in SQL Editor

### 2. Theme Import Fixes (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Fix color imports in 2 files:**

**File 1**: `/workspace/Resonare/src/screens/Profile/SettingsScreen.tsx` (line 24)
```typescript
// Change from:
import { colors, spacing } from '../../utils/theme';

// To:
import { theme, spacing } from '../../utils/theme';
const colors = theme.colors;
```

**File 2**: Same fix may be needed in other files if you see similar import errors

### 3. Test Core Social Features (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Essential functionality to verify:**
- [ ] User search works (Albums/Users toggle in Search tab)
- [ ] Follow/unfollow other users works
- [ ] Followers/Following lists display correctly
- [ ] Privacy settings toggle works
- [ ] User profile loading works without errors
