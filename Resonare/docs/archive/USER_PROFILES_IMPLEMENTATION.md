## ðŸ“± How to Test the Features

### 1. Testing User Discovery (Home Screen)

1. **Launch the app** and navigate to the Home tab
2. **Scroll down** to see the "Discover Friends" section
3. **Tap on any user card** - this should navigate to their profile
4. **Verify** the user profile loads with correct information

### 2. Testing User Profiles

1. **From Home screen**, tap on a suggested user (e.g., @indierocklover)
2. **Verify profile displays**:
   - User avatar, username, bio
   - Stats: Albums listened, Reviews, Following, Followers
   - Recent activity with timestamps
   - Follow button (should show "Follow" initially)
3. **Test follow functionality**:
   - Tap "Follow" button â†’ should change to "Following"
   - Button state should persist if you navigate away and back
4. **Test navigation**:
   - Back button should return to Home
   - Menu button (three dots) is present for future features

### 3. Testing Followers/Following Lists

1. **From a user profile**, tap on the "Following" or "Followers" stat card
2. **Verify FollowersScreen loads** with:
   - Proper header showing username
   - Tab buttons showing counts (e.g., "2 Followers", "1 Following")
   - User list with avatars, usernames, and bios
3. **Test tab switching**:
   - Tap between "Followers" and "Following" tabs
   - Lists should change appropriately
4. **Test user interactions**:
   - Tap on any user in the list â†’ navigate to their profile
   - Use Follow/Following buttons to test social actions
   - Back button should return to previous profile

### 4. Testing Multiple User Navigation

1. **Start from Home** â†’ tap user A
2. **From user A's profile** â†’ tap "Following" stat
3. **From followers list** â†’ tap user B
