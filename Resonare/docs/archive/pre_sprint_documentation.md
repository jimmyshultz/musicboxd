# Pre-Sprint Planning Documentation

Before starting work on Sprint 1, the following planning documents should be created to ensure a smooth development process.

## 1. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan

| Risk | Impact (H/M/L) | Probability (H/M/L) | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Spotify API rate limits or changes | H | M | Implement caching, fallback to alternative APIs, monitor for changes |
| React Native version compatibility issues | M | M | Lock dependency versions, document upgrade process |
| Team member availability/turnover | M | L | Document knowledge, maintain clear code standards |
| Scope creep | H | H | Maintain strict MVP definition, implement change request process |
| Performance issues with large music libraries | H | M | Implement pagination, virtualized lists, optimize queries |
| Authentication security vulnerabilities | H | L | Follow security best practices, conduct regular security reviews |
| App store rejection | H | L | Review app store guidelines early, plan for potential issues |

## 2. Technical Spikes

Before committing to specific implementation paths, these areas require investigation:

1. **Music API Evaluation**
   - Compare Spotify, Apple Music, and Last.fm APIs
   - Evaluate rate limits, data completeness, and authentication requirements
   - Document findings and recommend primary API

2. **React Native Navigation Options**
   - Evaluate React Navigation vs. other navigation libraries
   - Consider performance implications for deep navigation stacks
   - Test on both iOS and Android

3. **Offline Support Feasibility**
   - Investigate options for caching album data
   - Research best practices for offline-first architecture
   - Evaluate storage size limitations

## 3. Definition of Ready

Before a user story can be worked on, it must meet these criteria:

- Story has clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies are identified and resolved
- UI designs/wireframes are available (if applicable)
- Technical approach is agreed upon
- Story is estimated and sized appropriately
- Testability is confirmed

## 4. External API Integration Plan

### Spotify API
- Authentication flow (OAuth 2.0)
- Required endpoints:
  - Album search
  - Album details
  - Artist information
  - User library access
- Rate limits and handling
- Error scenarios and fallbacks

### Alternative APIs
- Last.fm API fallback approach
- Discogs API for extended metadata
- MusicBrainz for open data

## 5. Early Technical Decisions Document

To avoid inconsistencies later, document decisions on:

1. **Code Style & Conventions**
   - Naming conventions
   - File organization
   - Component structure
   - Test organization

2. **State Management Approach**
   - Redux vs. Context API
   - Store structure
   - Action patterns

3. **Authentication Implementation**
   - JWT vs. session approach
   - Token storage strategy
   - Refresh token handling

4. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Global error boundaries
   - Error reporting mechanism
   - User-facing error messaging

## 6. Accessibility Guidelines

- Target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Color contrast requirements
- Touch target size guidelines
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation support

## 7. Analytics & Monitoring Plan

- Key metrics to track
- Events to capture
- Crash reporting tools
- Performance monitoring approach

These documents should be created and reviewed by the team before beginning work on the first user story. They will provide a strong foundation for the development process and help avoid common pitfalls.
