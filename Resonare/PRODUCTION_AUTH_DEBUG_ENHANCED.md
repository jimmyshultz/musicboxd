# 🔍 Enhanced Production Authentication Debug

## Current Status

From your previous logs:
- ✅ **Environment**: Production configured correctly
- ✅ **Bundle ID**: `com.jimmyshultz.resonare` matches everywhere
- ✅ **Apple Module**: Imports correctly
- ❌ **Authentication**: Fails silently with "API key error"

## 🎯 Enhanced Debug Logging Added

I've added comprehensive logging to catch exactly where the failure occurs:

### **Button Press Logging:**
- `🍎 [DEBUG] AuthScreen: Apple button pressed`
- `🍎 [DEBUG] AuthScreen: handleAppleSignIn called`

### **Redux Thunk Logging:**
- `🍎 [DEBUG] authSlice: signInWithApple thunk started`
- `🍎 [DEBUG] authSlice: Checking Apple Sign-In availability`
- `🍎 [DEBUG] authSlice: Calling AuthService.signInWithApple`

### **Error Logging:**
- Complete error objects with stack traces
- Specific failure points identified

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Run Production Environment
```bash
ENVFILE=.env.production npm run ios
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment in Console
Look for:
```
🔧 Current Environment: production
[Production] Using production Supabase configuration
```

### Step 3: Test Apple Sign-In with Enhanced Logging
1. **Press Apple Sign-In button**
2. **Watch console for the complete flow**:
   ```
   🍎 [DEBUG] AuthScreen: Apple button pressed
   🍎 [DEBUG] AuthScreen: handleAppleSignIn called
   🍎 [DEBUG] authSlice: signInWithApple thunk started
   🍎 [DEBUG] authSlice: Checking Apple Sign-In availability
   🍎 [DEBUG] authSlice: Apple Sign-In available: true
   🍎 [DEBUG] authSlice: Calling AuthService.signInWithApple
   🍎 [DEBUG] Starting Apple Sign-In...
   🍎 [DEBUG] Requesting Apple Sign-In with scopes: EMAIL, FULL_NAME
   ```

### Step 4: Identify Failure Point
The enhanced logging will show **exactly where** the process fails:

**If you see no logs after button press:**
- Button event not firing
- React Native issue

**If logs stop at "Checking Apple Sign-In availability":**
- `isAppleSignInAvailable()` failing

**If logs stop at "Calling AuthService.signInWithApple":**
- `AuthService.signInWithApple()` failing immediately

**If logs stop at "Requesting Apple Sign-In":**
- `appleAuth.performRequest()` failing

**If you see "Apple Sign-In response" but then failure:**
- Supabase authentication issue

## 🎯 Most Likely Production Issues

### 1. Apple Developer Configuration
**Problem**: Production Apple Sign-In key not configured properly
**Debug**: Logs will show where `appleAuth.performRequest()` fails

### 2. Supabase Configuration
**Problem**: Production Supabase Apple provider misconfigured  
**Debug**: Logs will show Supabase authentication errors

### 3. Bundle ID Mismatch
**Problem**: Apple rejects sign-in due to Bundle ID mismatch
**Debug**: Apple will return specific error about Bundle ID

### 4. Missing Production Apple Key
**Problem**: Using development Apple key for production
**Debug**: Apple authentication will fail with key validation error

## 🆘 Next Steps

1. **Run the production app** with enhanced logging
2. **Try Apple Sign-In** and capture ALL console output
3. **Share the complete log sequence** - this will pinpoint exactly where it fails
4. **Note the exact on-screen error message** Apple shows

With the enhanced logging, we'll know exactly what's wrong within one test! 🎯

## 🔍 Also Test Google Sign-In

Try Google Sign-In too and see if:
- It has similar issues (suggests Supabase problem)
- It works fine (suggests Apple-specific configuration issue)

The enhanced logging will show us the exact failure point for both providers.
