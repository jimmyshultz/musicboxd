# üöÄ Simple Steps to Enable Apple Sign-In

You've successfully installed the pods, but the running app needs to restart to pick up the new Apple Authentication module.

## Quick Fix (3 steps):

### 1. Stop Everything
- **Stop Metro bundler**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running Metro
- **Close the app**: Close the iOS app on your simulator/device

### 2. Clean Restart
```bash
ENVFILE=.env.development npm run ios
```

### 3. Look for Apple Sign-In Button
- Should appear alongside Google Sign-In button on iOS
- Test both authentication methods

## That's it! 

The Apple Sign-In code is already integrated. You just need a fresh build to link the native modules.

**Expected result**: No more "Apple Authentication library not properly linked" messages, and you'll see the Apple Sign-In button! üçé
