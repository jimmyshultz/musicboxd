# üîÑ Restart App After Pod Install

## Issue: Apple Sign-In Still Not Working After Pod Install

You're seeing:
```
Apple Authentication library not properly linked
```

Even though `pod install` completed successfully.

## Root Cause

The **running app was built BEFORE the pods were installed**. React Native needs to rebuild to link the new native Apple Authentication module.

## Solution: Complete App Restart

### Step 1: Stop Everything
```bash
# Stop Metro bundler (Ctrl+C in the terminal running Metro)
# Or kill all Metro processes:
pkill -f "react-native start" || pkill -f "metro"

# Stop the iOS app (close it on simulator/device)
```

### Step 2: Clean Build (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Clean iOS build
cd ios
xcodebuild clean -workspace Resonare.xcworkspace -scheme Resonare
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Rebuild and Start Fresh
```bash
# Start with clean cache
ENVFILE=.env.development npm run ios
```

## Expected Results After Restart

‚úÖ **Console should show:**
- No more "Apple Authentication library not properly linked" messages
- Clean startup logs

‚úÖ **UI should show:**
- Apple Sign-In button appears alongside Google Sign-In (iOS only)
- Both buttons functional

## Why This Happens

React Native apps have two parts:
1. **JavaScript bundle** (can hot reload)
2. **Native modules** (require full rebuild)

When you add native dependencies like Apple Authentication:
- The JavaScript code can see the new imports
- But the native iOS code needs to be recompiled to include the new modules
- Running app still uses old native code without Apple Authentication

## Quick Test

After restarting, check the AuthScreen:
- iOS: Should see both Google and Apple Sign-In buttons
- Android: Should see only Google Sign-In button (normal)

The Apple Sign-In integration is complete - you just need a fresh build! üçé
