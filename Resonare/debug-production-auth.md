# üîç Debug Production Authentication Issues

## The Problem

You copied Apple Sign-In config from development to production, but it's not working. This is expected because:

**Apple Sign-In configurations are environment-specific and cannot be directly copied.**

## Why Copy/Paste Doesn't Work

### Apple Sign-In Issues:
1. **Bundle ID mismatch**: Production might use different Bundle ID
2. **Key restrictions**: Apple keys may be restricted to specific apps/environments
3. **Team ID context**: Keys are tied to specific Apple Developer team contexts
4. **Domain validation**: Apple validates the calling domain/app

### Google Sign-In Issues:
1. **OAuth restrictions**: Client IDs are often restricted to specific domains/apps
2. **Environment validation**: Google validates the calling environment

## üîß Step-by-Step Debug Process

### Step 1: Verify What Environment You're Actually Running

Run this first:
```bash
./check-production-env.sh
```

### Step 2: Check Console Logs

When you run production and try to sign in, look for:

**Environment confirmation:**
```
üîß Current Environment: production
[Production] Using production Supabase configuration
```

**Apple Sign-In debug logs:**
```
üçé [DEBUG] Apple Sign-In response: {...}
üçé [DEBUG] Apple User ID: ...
```

**Error messages:**
- What exactly does the Apple error say?
- Any Supabase authentication errors?

### Step 3: Verify Production Supabase Configuration

1. **Go to your production Supabase project**
2. **Authentication ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Apple**
3. **Verify these match your app:**
   - Client ID = Your actual Bundle ID
   - Team ID = Your Apple Developer Team ID
   - Key ID = The key you created
   - Private Key = Complete .p8 file content

### Step 4: Check Bundle ID Consistency

**In your app:**
- iOS project Bundle ID
- `.env.production` configuration
- Apple Developer Portal app registration

**In Supabase:**
- Apple provider Client ID should match Bundle ID exactly

## üéØ Most Likely Issues

### Issue 1: Bundle ID Mismatch
**Problem**: Production Supabase configured with wrong Bundle ID
**Solution**: 
1. Check your iOS project Bundle ID in Xcode
2. Update Supabase Apple provider Client ID to match exactly

### Issue 2: Wrong Apple Key
**Problem**: Using development Apple key for production
**Solution**: 
1. Create a new Apple Sign-In key specifically for production
2. Download new .p8 file
3. Update production Supabase with new Key ID and private key

### Issue 3: Environment Not Actually Production
**Problem**: App still running in development mode
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure you're using `ENVFILE=.env.production npm run ios`
2. Check console logs show "production" environment

### Issue 4: Incomplete .p8 Key Copy
**Problem**: Private key not copied completely
**Solution**: 
1. Open .p8 file in text editor
2. Copy ALL content including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`
3. Paste complete key into Supabase

## üîç Debug Commands

### Check your Bundle ID:
```bash
# In your iOS project
grep -r "PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER" ios/Resonare.xcodeproj/
```

### Check production environment file:
```bash
cat .env.production
```

### Run with verbose logging:
```bash
ENVFILE=.env.production npm run ios
# Then check console for detailed auth logs
```

## üÜò What I Need to Help You

Please share:

1. **The exact Apple error message** you see on screen
2. **Console logs** when trying to authenticate in production
3. **Confirmation** that you see "production" in the console logs
4. **Your Bundle ID** (from Xcode project settings)
5. **Whether you created a new Apple key** or reused the development one

With this info, I can pinpoint exactly what's misconfigured! üéØ
