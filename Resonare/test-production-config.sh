echo "=================================="

echo ""
echo "üì± Your project has these build configurations:"
echo "   - Debug (development)"
echo "   - Release (production) ‚Üê Archive uses this"
echo "   - Debug-Development"
echo "   - Release-Development" 
echo "   - Debug-Staging"
echo "   - Release-Staging"

echo ""
echo "üéØ For Production TestFlight Build:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Archive scheme should use 'Release' configuration"
echo "   ‚úÖ Build script should set ENVFILE=.env.production when CONFIGURATION=Release"
echo "   ‚úÖ Your .env.production should have ENVIRONMENT=production"

echo ""
echo "üîç Next steps:"
echo "   1. Add the Build Script Phase in Xcode (before Compile Sources)"
echo "   2. Verify Archive scheme uses Release configuration"
echo "   3. Create Archive build"
echo "   4. The build will automatically use .env.production"

echo ""
echo "üí° Why this works:"
echo "   - Archive always uses Release configuration"
echo "   - Build script detects Release configuration"
echo "   - Automatically sets ENVFILE=.env.production"
echo "   - react-native-config loads your production environment"
